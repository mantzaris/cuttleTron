# Screen shots, Screen/Window recorder, Sound/Voice mod/effects for Linux

1. Take screen shots of screens or application windows
2. Take videos that are saved to .webm format of either screens or specific application windows. The audio from the user choice is save along with it if chosen. The audio source does not need to originate from the overall system source or the same application producing the window (eg record video from your web browser and audio from an audio player like VLC).
3. Sound effects/mods, choose the source (eg the microphone or an application) and then select the effects like pitch shift or echo. This creates a new source of audio that can be used for applications like Skype or even in the screen record above after it is streaming.

### Requirements

Not all of the 'components' require these dependencies.

-  ffmpeg version >=4.2 (for audio recording with the screen record)
- "gstreamer1.0-tools", "gstreamer1.0-plugins-base", "gstreamer1.0-plugins-good", "gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad", "gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly" (for the audio effects and modifications)
